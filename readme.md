# Aerosoft A330 FDE Patch and sound improvements
in this patch package, I give you `"A330-343.air"` airfile and `"aircraft_patch.txt"` source patch config file to be used with your `"aircraft.cfg`


#FDE Improvements :
- Fuel Consumption. Simply put, it burns fuel like what it should
- Flight Model and Flight Characteristics, it should behave like every other bus, at least. 

installation :
1. backup your original aircraft.cfg (by copypasta it and name it something else like aircraft_orig.cfg)
2. in `"aircraft.cfg"`, the one which you didnt rename, you're gonna patch it with given `"aircraft_patch.txt"` by
	2.1 replace everything inside `aircraft.cfg` with texts in `aircraft_patch.txt.` now you've patched the config, great.
	2.2 then, you take `[fltsim]` section, aka liveries, back to your `"patched"` config from your backup (to restore your liveries. of course!)
3. now replace your `"A330-343.air"` with given one, back up on your discretion, I suggest don't since old fde flies like shit.


# Sound Enhancement
aside FDE patch, I also ship you sound enhancement.
Aural RA included A330/A340 RA from the net.

installation
1. navigate to `SimObjects\Airplanes\Aerosoft A330 Professional Base`, you'd see a folder named `sound_asc`, make a backup by simply renaming it to sth else (can skip if don't want to backup, who would?)
2. replace that folder with given `sound_asc` (copy-paste the folder, replace contents if asked, of course). 


# Potato VC Textures
2k downscaled VC textures for better vram usage.

installation
1. Navigate to `SimObjects\Airplanes\Aerosoft A333 RR Professional`, you will see a folder named `texture_FallbackVC`,
2. go in that folder then put these new textures innit.
